# pi-sap-aicore

A custom provider extension for the [pi coding agent](https://pi.dev) that routes
inference through **SAP AI Core** — via the **orchestration** service (every model
from a single deployment) and/or **direct foundation deployments** (per-model
Azure OpenAI endpoints with native streaming). Both register at once and share one
login, so you pick the route per model. See
[Orchestration vs. Foundation](#orchestration-vs-foundation).

## Prerequisites

- pi **0.78.0 or newer** installed (`npm install -g @earendil-works/pi-coding-agent`)
- An SAP BTP account with AI Core entitlement and an **orchestration deployment**
- *(optional, for the foundation provider)* one or more **foundation-models
  deployments** — one per OpenAI model you want to route directly
- The service key JSON for your AI Core service binding

## Credentials

The extension looks for the SAP BTP service-key JSON in this order:

1. **Pi's auth store** — `~/.pi/agent/auth.json`, populated by `/login` (see below).
   Persisted across sessions, file-permission-locked by pi.
2. **`AICORE_SERVICE_KEY` environment variable** — per-shell override. Useful for
   testing against a different tenant for one session without re-running `/login`.

If neither is present, inference fails with a clear "no service key configured" error.

Both providers — `sap-aicore` (orchestration) and `sap-aicore-foundation` — use the
**same** service key, so a single `/login` (or one `AICORE_SERVICE_KEY`) covers
both. pi keys stored credentials per provider, so the foundation provider reads the
shared login from pi's auth store directly; you never log in twice.

### Recommended: `/login`

From inside pi:

```
/login
```

Then:
1. Pick **Use a subscription**.
2. Pick **SAP AI Core**.
3. At the prompt, paste your BTP service-key JSON as a single line and hit enter.
   It's validated immediately — if anything is missing or malformed, you'll get a
   specific error pointing at the field, so you can re-run `/login` and fix it.

Pi stores the JSON in `~/.pi/agent/auth.json` for future sessions.

To get the JSON: BTP cockpit → your AI Core service instance → Service Keys
→ View. Copy the entire JSON object.

> **Why "Use a subscription" and not "Use an API key"?** SAP service keys contain
> a `$` in their `clientsecret`. Since pi 0.77, keys stored via "Use an API key"
> are run through a `$`-interpolating template resolver that mangles them. The
> extension registers credentials through pi's `oauth` mechanism instead, which
> stores and returns the key verbatim. It's not real OAuth — it's just the path
> that keeps your key intact. (See [pi issue #5095](https://github.com/earendil-works/pi/issues/5095).)

> **Upgrading from an older install?** If you previously logged in via
> "Use an API key" (stored as `{"type":"api_key"}` in `auth.json`), re-run
> `/login` **once** via **Use a subscription** to convert the stored credential.
> A single re-login is all that's needed.

### Alternative: `AICORE_SERVICE_KEY` env var

```bash
export AICORE_SERVICE_KEY='{"clientid":"...","clientsecret":"...","url":"https://...authentication.sap.hana.ondemand.com","serviceurls":{"AI_API_URL":"https://api.ai.<region>.ml.hana.ondemand.com"}}'
```

The `@sap-ai-sdk/orchestration` SDK reads this directly for XSUAA auth, token
caching, and deployment resolution — no manual token plumbing needed.

## Install

### From npm (recommended)

```bash
pi install npm:pi-sap-aicore
```

pi downloads the package under `~/.pi/agent/npm/`, runs `npm install` to pull the
SAP AI SDKs, and auto-loads the extension on every startup. Run the one command on
each machine; `pi update` keeps it current. Pin a version with
`pi install npm:pi-sap-aicore@<version>` (pinned specs are skipped by `pi update`).

Then configure credentials with `/login` (see [Credentials](#credentials)) and
confirm the models are visible:

```bash
pi --list-models | grep sap-aicore
```

### Local development (this repo)

```bash
npm install
pi -e ./index.ts --list-models
```

You'll see the orchestration models under `sap-aicore/` (Claude, GPT-5*, Gemini),
plus any direct **foundation** models under `sap-aicore-foundation/`:
- `sap-aicore/anthropic--claude-4.7-opus` — Claude Opus 4.7 (orchestration)
- `sap-aicore/gpt-5.5` — GPT-5.5 via orchestration
- `sap-aicore-foundation/gpt-5.5` — GPT-5.5 via its direct foundation deployment

Run `pi -e ./index.ts` to launch pi with the local extension loaded; this
overrides any globally-installed version for the session, which is the fastest
iteration loop while developing.

### Alternative: install from git

For an unpublished fork or a branch you want to track directly:

```bash
pi install git:github.com/ttiimmaahh/pi-sap-aicore@main
```

pi clones to `~/.pi/agent/git/…`, runs `npm install`, and auto-loads on startup.
Note: an `@main` git install is **not** moved to newer commits by `pi update` (it
only reconciles to the pinned ref) — prefer the npm install above for hands-off
updates.

## Orchestration vs. Foundation

The extension registers **two providers**, both backed by the same service key:

| | `sap-aicore` (orchestration) | `sap-aicore-foundation` (direct) |
|---|---|---|
| SAP deployment | one orchestration deployment fronts **every** model | one foundation deployment **per model** |
| Models | Claude, GPT-5*, Gemini | OpenAI (`gpt-*`) only |
| Streaming | subject to orchestration's per-model allow-list — new models can 400 `Streaming is not supported` (we fall back to non-streaming) | **native** — streams straight from the Azure OpenAI endpoint |
| Reasoning effort | tunable (`reasoning_effort` / `thinking`) | model **default** only (SDK pins Azure API `2024-10-21`, which has no `reasoning_effort`) |
| Content filter / grounding / templating | yes | no — raw model access |
| SDK | `@sap-ai-sdk/orchestration` | `@sap-ai-sdk/foundation-models` (`AzureOpenAiChatClient`) |

Both routes appear in the model list simultaneously, so you choose per model. The
foundation route exists mainly to get **native streaming** for new OpenAI models
that orchestration hasn't enabled streaming for yet (e.g. `gpt-5.5`).

**Adding a foundation model:** it needs its own foundation-models deployment in
SAP AI Core — one per (model, version, resource group); the SDK resolves it by
model name, so no deployment IDs to wire in. Then add its `id` to
`FOUNDATION_MODEL_IDS` in [`src/models-config.ts`](./src/models-config.ts)
(definitions are reused from the shared snapshot). An id with no matching
deployment 404s at call time. Run `node scripts/list-sap-models.mjs` to see what
your tenant actually deploys.

## Models

The model list is composed of two sources, merged at startup:

1. **`src/models-snapshot.json`** — auto-generated from
   [models.dev](https://models.dev)'s SAP AI Core catalog. Refresh with:
   ```bash
   npm run update-models
   ```
   This re-fetches the live catalog, applies our family-specific filters
   (currently anthropic claude-4.x, gpt-5*, gemini-2.5*), and writes the
   snapshot to disk. Commit the result.

2. **`TENANT_EXTRAS` in [`src/models-config.ts`](./src/models-config.ts)** —
   hand-maintained list of models that exist in your SAP tenant but
   aren't (yet) in the models.dev catalog. Same `SapModel` shape. Extras
   win over snapshot on duplicate `id`.

To add a model that everyone on your team should see, add it to
`TENANT_EXTRAS` and commit. To add a per-machine custom (your own tenant
only), use pi's built-in custom-models mechanism by editing
`~/.pi/agent/models.json` — no extension changes required.

The `cost` fields are vendor list prices (USD per million tokens) from
models.dev. Used **only** for pi's in-UI cost display — your actual SAP
BTP invoice is contract-based and will differ.

## Thinking levels

Models with `reasoning: true` honor pi's thinking-level cycle (default
keybind `Shift+Tab`): `off`, `minimal`, `low`, `medium`, `high`, `xhigh`.

- **Anthropic 4.6+ models** (`anthropic--claude-4.6-*`, `4.7-*`) use
  *adaptive* thinking — `thinking: {type: "adaptive"}` + `output_config:
  {effort}`. The model decides the budget; the level only nudges depth.
- **Older Anthropic models** (`anthropic--claude-4-*`, `4.5-*`) use
  *budget-token* thinking — `thinking: {type: "enabled", budget_tokens: N}`.
  Each pi level maps to a token count (1k / 4k / 8k / 16k / 32k for
  minimal/low/medium/high/xhigh), clamped down so `max_tokens` always
  has at least 1024 tokens of headroom for the response. SAP rejects
  the adaptive shape on these models ("adaptive thinking is not
  supported on this model"), which is why we split.

**Note on reasoning visibility:** SAP orchestration does NOT pass
structured reasoning/thinking content through to streaming clients.
The model genuinely reasons (you'll see step-by-step structure leak
into the visible answer text, and the tokens are billed via
`completion_tokens_details.reasoning_tokens`), but pi's dedicated
"thinking" panel will stay empty for SAP-routed models — there's no
client-side fix. If SAP exposes a server-side flag for this in the
future, our `pickReasoning` probe is wired and ready in `stream.ts`.
- **OpenAI models** (`gpt-*`) use `reasoning_effort: "minimal" | "low"
  | "medium" | "high"`. `xhigh` is omitted — OpenAI has no equivalent
  tier; pi will skip it when cycling.
- **Gemini models** (`gemini-2.5-*`) ship with `reasoning: false` —
  SAP's gemini reasoning passthrough is undocumented, so we keep
  `Shift+Tab` off the cycle for these models rather than send a request
  shape SAP may reject. Wire-up (likely `thinking_config.thinking_budget`)
  is a future TODO in `src/stream.ts:reasoningParams`.

**Foundation route caveat:** on `sap-aicore-foundation/*` the direct Azure
OpenAI SDK pins API version `2024-10-21`, which has no `reasoning_effort`
field — so gpt-5\* reason at their **default** effort and pi's thinking-level
cycle is a no-op there. The models still reason (reasoning tokens are billed
and show in `output`); the depth just isn't tunable. Use the orchestration
route (`sap-aicore/*`) when you need to set the effort level.

To override budgets per model, edit `thinkingLevelMap` on the relevant
entry in `TENANT_EXTRAS`, or override per-user via pi's `models.json`.

## AI Resource Group

Resolved in this order:

1. **`AICORE_RESOURCE_GROUP` env var** — per-shell override. Example:
   ```bash
   export AICORE_RESOURCE_GROUP=my-team-rg
   ```
2. **`resourceGroup` field on the service-key JSON** — convenient for teams
   who manage multiple groups and want to bake the default into the key.
   Non-standard, so add it yourself before pasting into pi:
   ```json
   { "clientid": "...", "clientsecret": "...", "resourceGroup": "my-team-rg", ... }
   ```
3. **SAP's server-side default** (`default`) — if neither of the above is set.

The value is passed via SAP's `OrchestrationClient(..., {resourceGroup})`
constructor arg, which is the only supported channel — `AI-Resource-Group`
as a request header is explicitly rejected by SAP's typings. The foundation
provider applies the same resolved group via
`AzureOpenAiChatClient({ modelName, resourceGroup })`; both a model's foundation
deployment and the orchestration deployment must live in the resolved group for
name-based resolution to find them.

## Prompt caching & cost reporting

**Cache read/write tokens always report 0** on SAP-routed turns. SAP
orchestration strips all detail fields from the TokenUsage response
— we only get `prompt_tokens`, `completion_tokens`, and `total_tokens`
across every route. There's no `prompt_tokens_details.cached_tokens`
(OpenAI) and no top-level `cache_read_input_tokens` (Anthropic) for
the client to read.

Whether the backend actually caches is invisible to pi. SAP's
contract billing may give you a discount on cached tokens that this
extension can't surface — check your BTP invoice if cache savings
matter.

**Experimental:** `PI_SAP_AICORE_CACHE_CONTROL=1` tags the system
prompt and last user message with Anthropic's `cache_control:
{type:"ephemeral"}`. SAP may forward it (saving SAP money on the
backend, possibly passed through via your contract) or may 400 the
request. Either way, you won't see cacheRead become non-zero in pi's
diagnostics — that requires SAP to expose detail fields, which they
currently don't.

OpenAI/Gemini routes ignore the flag — they have their own automatic
caching with no breakpoint API.

**Foundation route:** because it talks to the Azure OpenAI endpoint directly
(not through orchestration's usage-stripping), `prompt_tokens_details.cached_tokens`
*may* come back populated — `mapUsage` reads it, so `cacheRead` could be non-zero
on `sap-aicore-foundation/*` turns where orchestration always reports 0. Unverified
against SAP's proxy; treat as best-effort.

## Releasing (maintainers)

Releases are **tag-driven** and published to npm by GitHub Actions. There is no
build step — pi loads the `.ts` sources directly via jiti — so a release is just
*verify + publish*.

1. Update `CHANGELOG.md`: move items from `[Unreleased]` into a new version
   heading.
2. Bump the version (this commits `package.json` and creates a `vX.Y.Z` tag):
   ```bash
   npm version patch   # or minor / major
   git push --follow-tags
   ```
3. The [`Publish`](.github/workflows/publish.yml) workflow fires on the `v*` tag,
   asserts the tag matches `package.json`, typechecks, and publishes.

Every push to `main` and every PR also runs the [`CI`](.github/workflows/ci.yml)
typecheck gate.

### One-time setup: npm Trusted Publishing (OIDC)

Publishing is **tokenless** — no `NPM_TOKEN` secret. Authorize this repo once on
npmjs.com:

1. npmjs.com → the `pi-sap-aicore` package → **Settings** → **Trusted Publisher**.
2. Choose **GitHub Actions** and enter (case-sensitive, exact match):
   - **Organization or user:** `ttiimmaahh`
   - **Repository:** `pi-sap-aicore`
   - **Workflow filename:** `publish.yml`
   - **Allowed actions:** `npm publish`
3. Save. The next `v*` tag publishes automatically, with provenance attestations.

> The first CI release must be a version **newer than the last manually published
> one** (`0.1.0`) — npm rejects republishing an existing version.
